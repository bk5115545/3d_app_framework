###Advanced Game Programming Final###

This originally started out as my final project in Advanced Game Programming,
but it's come a long way since then with 3D capabilities thanks to a new renderer
written in OpenGL, as well as greatly increased speed thanks to Bryan's Threaded
Event System that he originally wrote for his Advanced Game Programming class.

To compile this project you'll require SDL2, SDL2_image, GLM, GLEW, and an OpenGL
capable GPU and accompanying graphics driver. You'll also need CMake and whichever
compiler toolchain you would prefer, be it Visual Studio, GCC, or Clang.
